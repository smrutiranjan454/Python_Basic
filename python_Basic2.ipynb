    "#5.explain the concept of type casting in python with examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. In Python, type casting can be done using built-in functions. There are two types of type casting:\n",
    "\n",
    "#      Implicit Type Casting: The Python interpreter automatically converts one data type to another without the programmer's intervention.\n",
    "#     Explicit Type Casting: The programmer manually converts one data type to another using built-in functions.\n",
    "   \n",
    "#      Implicit Type Casting:\n",
    "#             In implicit type casting, Python automatically converts a smaller data type to a larger data type to prevent data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "            # Implicit type casting\n",
    "            x = 10          # int\n",
    "            y = 2.5         # float\n",
    "\n",
    "            # x is automatically converted to float and the result is a float\n",
    "            result = x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "            print(result)  # Output: 12.5\n",
    "            print(type(result))  # Output: <class 'float'>\n",
    "           # In this example, the integer x is implicitly converted to a float during the addition operation to match the type of y, resulting in a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "#             Explicit Type Casting\n",
    "#             In explicit type casting, we use built-in functions to convert a variable from one data type to another.\n",
